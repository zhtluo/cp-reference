For non-negative integers $m$ and $n$ and a prime $p$, the following congruence relation holds:

$${\displaystyle {\binom {m}{n}}\equiv \prod _{i=0}^{k}{\binom {m_{i}}{n_{i}}}{\pmod {p}},}$$
where

$${\displaystyle m=m_{k}p^{k}+m_{k-1}p^{k-1}+\cdots +m_{1}p+m_{0},}$$
and

$${\displaystyle n=n_{k}p^{k}+n_{k-1}p^{k-1}+\cdots +n_{1}p+n_{0}}$$

are the base p expansions of m and n respectively. This uses the convention that ${\displaystyle {\tbinom {m}{n}}=0}$ if $m < n$.
